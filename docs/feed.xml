      <p>To be a TOP-50 Kaggler is very hard. You must have a master of grandmaster tier. It is really high requirement. And it is not possible to achive this place by accident.</p>
<p>When I set this goal I don't know that Kaggle has four different <em>categories of expertise</em>. After reading <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/progression">this article</a> I understand that I want to achive expertiese in Competition category. And all other categories don't make sence for me.</p>
<p>It is useful to eat elephant piece-by-piece so I will do it in this way.</p>
<p>So <strong>first big goal</strong> is to achive Expert tier in Competition category.<br>
To achieve it I need to get 2 bronse medals in competitions.</p>
<p>What I need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>check competitions and find one where I want to participate.</li>
<li>read another users notebooks and read about their approaches.</li>
</ul>

      <p>Here the sentence: &quot;Decision Trees are a type of model&quot;.</p>
<p>OK, seems true.</p>
<p>But what is a model?<br>
As I understand, model - is a function. And this function take data in and return something out.
But this function not &quot;static&quot;, it is not just a piece of code or some mapping for values. It is a mathematical function that can be &quot;trained&quot;. So it could improve over time by Machine Learning algorithms.</p>
<pre class="language-python"><code class="language-python">model <span class="token operator">=</span> DecisionTreeModel<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><br>model<span class="token punctuation">.</span>fit<span class="token punctuation">(</span>training_data<span class="token punctuation">,</span> results<span class="token punctuation">)</span><br>results <span class="token operator">=</span> model<span class="token punctuation">.</span>predict<span class="token punctuation">(</span>test_data<span class="token punctuation">)</span></code></pre>
<p>ðŸ‘† it is just an example, where model is an object with several methods. But, as I understand, it makes for comfortable model usage in code.</p>
<p>Here is what Wikipedia writes about it:<br>
A mathematical model is <strong>a description</strong> of a system using mathematical concepts and language.</p>

      <ul>
<li>
<p>Reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>Hard to get into the course</li>
<li>Need some instructions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What meens fully-connected?
New words: regression, classification, stochastic gradient descent, dropout, batch normalization, dense layer (Just your regular densely-connected NN layer), TPU (tensor computation)
Yamshikov said that I need to know more about statistics to solve problems with easy more effective approach</p>
<p>What we talk about and hipe about is:
-&gt; Some of the most impressive advances in artificial intelligence in recent years have been in the field of deep learning.</p>
<p>Why we need a bias in our neurons?</p>
