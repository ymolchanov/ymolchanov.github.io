      <p>To be a TOP-50 Kaggler is very hard. You must have a master of grandmaster tier. It is really high requirement. And it is not possible to achive this place by accident.</p>
<p>When I set this goal I don't know that Kaggle has four different <em>categories of expertise</em>. After reading <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/progression">this article</a> I understand that I want to achive expertiese in Competition category. And all other categories don't make sence for me.</p>
<p>It is useful to eat elephant piece-by-piece so I will do it in this way.</p>
<p>So <strong>first big goal</strong> is to achive Expert tier in Competition category.<br>
To achieve it I need to get 2 bronse medals in competitions.</p>
<p>What I need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>check competitions and find one where I want to participate.</li>
<li>read another users notebooks and read about their approaches.</li>
</ul>
