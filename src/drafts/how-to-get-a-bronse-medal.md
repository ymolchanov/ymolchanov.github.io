To be a TOP-50 Kaggler is very hard. You must have a master of grandmaster tier. It is really high requirement. And it is not possible to achive this place by accident.

When I set this goal I don't know that Kaggle has four different _categories of expertise_. After reading [this article](https://www.kaggle.com/progression) I understand that I want to achive expertiese in Competition category. And all other categories don't make sence for me.

It is useful to eat elephant piece-by-piece so I will do it in this way.

So **first big goal** is to achive Expert tier in Competition category.  
To achieve it I need to get 2 bronse medals in competitions.

What I need to do:

- check competitions and find one where I want to participate.
- read another users notebooks and read about their approaches.
