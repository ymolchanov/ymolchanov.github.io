- Reasons

  - Hard to get into the course
  - Need some instructions

What meens fully-connected?
New words: regression, classification, stochastic gradient descent, dropout, batch normalization, dense layer (Just your regular densely-connected NN layer), TPU (tensor computation)
Yamshikov said that I need to know more about statistics to solve problems with easy more effective approach

What we talk about and hipe about is:
-> Some of the most impressive advances in artificial intelligence in recent years have been in the field of deep learning.

Why we need a bias in our neurons?
