To be a TOP-50 Kaggler is very hard. You must have a master of grandmaster tier. It is really high requirement. And it is not possible to achive this place by accident.

When I set this goal I don't know that Kaggle has four different _categories of expertise_. After reading [this article](https://www.kaggle.com/progression) I understand that I want to achive expertiese in Competition category. And all other categories don't make sence for me.

It is useful to eat elephant piece-by-piece so I will do it in this way.

So **first big goal** is to achive Expert tier in Competition category.  
To achieve it I need to get 2 bronse medals in competitions.

What I need to do:

- understand in what field I need to improve my expertise (it is important, because I can't be good in every field of Machine Learning)
- learn courses and read about it
- check competition in this field (like computer vision)
